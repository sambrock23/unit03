<p> Since I have been at college, I have gained some valuable work experience. For example, working in the caf√© 
'Bygones'. I was working in the back doing general chores like washing dishes and peeling vegetables, these were important jobs and 
vital to the cafe.

I  worked in the Norfolk Hospice charity shop. I started out in the back of the shop by hanging clothes and price tagging them. I then 
was given the job of steaming the clothes ready for them to go out into the shop. My next job was out the front stocking the shelves, taking 
clothes off the rails, working on the till, taking cash and giving the customers their change.

 In my time doing work experience I have learnt so much in different environments as I gained a number of new skills, met many different people 
and gained experience in communication and social skills.</p>

<p>The role I did was very similar to the role I did above.</p>
