* Missed a few capital letters on the 'Homepage'. Missed a ':' in 'Unit 13'. 

* I recommend checking over the whole document again and fixing any spelling and grammatical errors.

* The portfolio is very nice looking and informative, the information provided is interesting and enagaging. There are photos provided for all pages that fit what that page talked about. I enjoyed it.

I really like the layout and the theme that's going on, it looks fun and not overwhelming. I also like the colours and the text font as it's easy to read. As I was reading, I did notice some grammar that needs fixing, but overall I really like it and looks great.

My website meets my target audience. My work experience is included, and I also have images on my website. I have included unit 13 and 3 other pages are included. There is my contact page which has all the information about how to get in touch with me.


## purpose and Audience
 
 I have used the digital portfolio to attracted potential IT employers by showing that I have numerous skills in various IT areas such as CSS,Coding,bootstrap and many more. This is all clearly demonstrated on my Unit 13 page.
