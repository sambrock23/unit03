 <p>My hobbies include diamond painting.Diamond Painting is the name of a mosaic art form in which the artist creates a 
painting by sticking small resins that sparkle like diamonds on a canvas that has corresponding numbers printed by all the colors of the diamonds.
 I enjoy bowling, clothes shopping, cinima and swimming</p>
