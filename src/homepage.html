<p>This is my homepage you can navigate to my content pages. Everything about my Education and 
    the grades I achieved and any work Experience I have completed. Unit 13 is about Web development; this is all about creating a website about yourself and the 
    topics. M.O.S is about Microsoft Office Specialist, which includes, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. My personal page will be about what I like, my skills and my 
    hobbies. Finally, my contact page is about my contact details, should I need to be contacted.</p>

<p>During my level 2 Course, I have gained many skills and learnt about many different IT programmes. Online world, database's and MOS being three of them. 
    I have also been learning about coding. I have, as part of my course, completed assignments and I am, at the 
    present, working on my website and portfolio assignment.
